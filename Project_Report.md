## 🛠️ Technical Process (The Workflow)

### 1. Data Cleaning (ETL)
The raw data required transformation to be analysis-ready:
* **Date Handling:** Extracted `Month` and `Year` from the primary Date column to allow for monthly trend analysis.
* **Calculated Metrics:** Created a `Margin Amount` column using the formula:
  > `Sales Amount * Margin %`
* **Data Standardization:** Ensured consistency in City names and Service categories.

### 2. Data Analysis & Pivot Tables
Key analysis performed using Pivot Tables:
* **Customer Segmentation:** Analyzed the split between "Company" vs. "Individual" clients.
* **Service Performance:** Compared revenue generated by Marketing vs. Design departments.
* **Top Clients:** Identified key accounts based on total lifetime value.

### 3. Dashboard Design
* **Interactive Slicers:** Added filters for **Year**, **City**, and **Service** to allow users to drill down into specific data points.
* **Visualizations:** Used Bar charts for categorical comparison and Line charts for time-series analysis.
